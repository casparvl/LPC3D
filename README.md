MultiXscale project: Towards the efficient simulation of supercapacitors at the mesoscopic scale

A code to do mesoscopic simulations of ions diffusing in carbon particles

This code was written by El Hassane Lahrar and CÃ©line Merlet, with contributions from Rudolf Weber, and was used in one published work:

"Understanding the chemical shifts of aqueous electrolyte species adsorbed in carbon nanopores", J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 13, 8953 (2022), https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c02260

"Investigating the effect of particle size distribution and complex exchange dynamics on NMR spectra of ions diffusing in disordered porous carbons through a mesoscopic model", Faraday Discuss., Advance article, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2024/FD/D4FD00082J 

Here, a manual and example input files are provided.
